# ML-CafeShop: Gesture-Based Interactive Interface

Welcome to **ML-CafeShop**, an innovative project that combines **computer vision** and **hand tracking** to create an interactive, gesture-based selection interface. This project allows users to make selections in a virtual cafÃ© environment using hand gestures, providing a natural and engaging alternative to traditional input methods like keyboards or touchscreens.

## Introduction
The **ML-CafeShop** project is designed to provide an intuitive and immersive user experience by leveraging **OpenCV** and **hand tracking** techniques. Users can interact with a virtual cafÃ© interface using hand gestures, such as selecting coffee types or drink sizes. The system captures user selections and stores them for further processing or analysis.

This project is ideal for applications in **interactive displays**, **virtual reality (VR)**, **gaming interfaces**, and more. It demonstrates the potential of gesture-based interaction in creating engaging and user-friendly digital systems.

## Key Features
- **Real-Time Hand Detection & Tracking**: Utilizes **OpenCV** and the **cvzone.HandTrackingModule** for accurate hand gesture recognition.
- **Intuitive Gesture Mappings**: Maps natural hand gestures to specific actions, such as selecting menu items.
- **Visual Feedback**: Provides real-time visual cues, animations, and selection indicators to guide users.
- **Personalization**: Allows users to input their names and stores their selections for personalized order processing.
- **Data Capture**: Records user selections in a text file (`orders.txt`) for further analysis or reporting.

---

## Technologies Used
- **OpenCV**: For real-time video capture, hand detection, and image processing.
- **cvzone.HandTrackingModule**: A custom module for advanced hand tracking with high accuracy.
- **Python**: The core programming language used for developing the application.

## Installation and Setup
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Kuliumi24/ML-Cafeshop.git
   cd ML-Cafeshop
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Python installed, then install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python cvzone
   ```

3. **Run the Application**:
   Execute the main script to launch the interactive interface:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

4. **Interact with the Interface**:
   Use your hand gestures to navigate and make selections in the virtual cafÃ©.

## How It Works
1. **Hand Detection**: The system captures video frames from the camera and uses **OpenCV** and **cvzone.HandTrackingModule** to detect and track the user's hand in real-time.
2. **Gesture Mapping**: Specific hand gestures are mapped to actions, such as selecting a coffee type or drink size.
3. **Visual Feedback**: The interface provides visual cues (e.g., animations, icons) to indicate the user's current selection.
4. **Data Storage**: User selections, along with their names, are stored in a text file (`orders.txt`) for further processing.

---

## Usage
- Launch the application and position your hand in front of the camera.
- Use predefined hand gestures to navigate the menu and make selections.
- Enter your name when prompted to personalize your order.
- View your selections in the `orders.txt` file.

---

## Future Work
- **Advanced Gesture Recognition**: Implement machine learning to recognize more complex gestures.
- **Multi-Modal Interaction**: Add support for voice commands or touch-based inputs.
- **IoT Integration**: Connect the interface with IoT devices for smart home or cafÃ© automation.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Extend the system to work on mobile devices, AR/VR headsets, and other platforms.
